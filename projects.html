                        <b>Project Description: </b>SharkIO is a Web Application which allows users to subscribe and manage their subscription to a generic digital service (in this case a google chrome extension).
                        To access the service users have to login with their Discord Account. Once logged in, they can subscribe to the service by paying with their credit card. The payment 
                        flow has been implemented by using Stripe's technologies. In this case, the subscription is composed by an initial setup fee, plus a recurrent monthly payment. Once that 
                        users are subscribed to the service, they can access their personal dashboard, through which thay can retrive all the information related to their subscription, or perform 
                        some actions such as:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Manage their subscription.

                        the Museo Nazionale Scienza e Tecnologia Leonardo da Vinci during the Covid pandemic. 
                        The objective was to create one single robot, easy to use, that could be deployed by anyone who 
                        reads the simple manual and that accomplish two different missions:

                                First scenario is during covid, so the idea was to attract people at 
                                train stations, or semi-public areas with the objective of getting peoples 
                                attention and inviting them to visit the virtual exposition.

                        exploiting interactive graphs and plots. By the implementation of AI algorithms

                        The project is dedicated to solve an image classification problem on a proposed dataset. 
                        In particular, the purpose is to classify images depicting groups of people based on the number of masked people. 
                        In the specific, the solution must discriminate between images depending on the following cases:
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                All the people in the image are wearing a mask.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                No person in the image is wearing a mask.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Someone in the image is not wearing a mask.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        Being a classification problem, given an image, the goal has been to predict the correct class label by implementing 
                        a Convolutional Neural Network using the popular Tensorflow framework. Different approaches has been used in order to select the model with the best performances on the specified task. 
                        In particular, the approaches used consisted of implementing several models from scratch (in order to select the one with the right complexity w.r.t. the training data) 
                        and of exploiting the knowledge of some pretrained models by using the Transfer Learning Technique.
